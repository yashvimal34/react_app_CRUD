# Account App (React)

Simple React (frontend-only) application that allows users to register, log in, and view/edit their profile.

## Features
- Register new user
- Login with email + password
- View and edit profile
- Protected profile page
- Simple validation and error handling
- Uses Bootstrap for styling
- Data stored in `localStorage` (no backend)

## How to run
1. Clone repo
2. `npm install` (or `yarn`)
3. `npm start`

## Notes
- This is a basic implementation for demo / test submission.
- Passwords are stored in plain text in localStorage for simplicity. For production you must use a backend and hash passwords.
